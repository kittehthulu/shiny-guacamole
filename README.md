Y'know, math stuff.


Generic python scripts, so run them in the usual way.

utils.py contains various functions that have been used in two or more solutions, e.g. a Fibonacci generator.

runner.py contains various decorators and superclasses useful for running and debugging, e.g. runifmain() gets rid of the usual `if __name__ == "__main__"` cruft.
